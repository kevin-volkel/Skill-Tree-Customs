    <p class="testimonial1">I wanted to get into streaming but my old PC wouldn't cut it. The guys at Skill Tree were so
        helpful! Now I can play games AND stream at the same time!</p>
    <p class="testimonial2">My kids managed to find a a screwdriver and mess with some things inside my computer. I had
        no idea what to do but Skill Tree did! They even upgraded my PC too!</p>
    <p class="testimonial3">A lot of the PCs they have on display in the store look like serious machines, but don't let
        that turn you away if you need a simple PC. I got one for my grandparents and they love it! Good to know they
        have someone who can trust if they have problems.</p>
